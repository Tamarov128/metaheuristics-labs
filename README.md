# Metaheuristics laboratories
This repository contains labwork done for my Metaheuristics course.
The algorithms developed aim to solve the following problems:
1. The Knapsack Problem
   - with 2 testing instances (20 and 200 objects)
2. The Travelling Salesman Problem
   - with 2 testing instances (101 and 9152 cities)
3. The Function Minimization Problem
   - 2 real valued continuous functions considered (Sphere and Weighted Sphere)
  
The metaheuristics which I have implemented are:
- Exhaustive Search & Random Search (lab1)
- Random Hill Climbing & Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing (lab2)
- Tabu Search (lab3)
- Simulated Annealing (lab4)
- Evolutionary Algorithms (lab5 & lab6)
- Particle Swarm Optimization (lab7)
- Ant System & Ant Colony Optimization (lab8)

Each lab consists of a Jupyter notebook which documents the following:
- problem  definition
- algorithm  used  (name, steps/pseudocode)
- parameter setting
- comparative results of experiments
- discussion of results.
